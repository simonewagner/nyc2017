<p>New York is America's safest large city, but visitors should still use common sense to protect themselves and their property.<br> Be aware of your surroundings, and make sure to always use licensed, reputable businesses for any services you need.   </p>

<ul>
	<li>Only buy MetroCards from MetroCard kiosks in stations or approved vendors.</li>
<br><br>
	<li>When a taxi is available, the light on its roof (which displays the cab's individual medallion number) is illuminated. When a taxi is taken, the light is switched off.</li>
	<br><br>
	<li>Be careful of the renegade Disney, Sesame Street and superhero characters in Times Square. Not officially licensed by their creators, and usually in costumes that seem a tad different from the genuine article, these individuals are generally hustling for tips</li>
	<br><br>
	<li>It's not always advertised, but the admission price at many museums in New York City (even the big ones) is actually just a suggestion—meaning that you pay what you can afford, even if it's only a dollar.</li>

<p>Don’t double tip. Be sure to read your bill at restaurants before you leave gratuities, especially if you are in a tourist district.  Many restaurants are already prepared for tourists who leave insufficient gratuities and build in an 18% service charge (probably what you are used to at home)</p>

<p>Have your travel health insurance.The U.S. and Canada have the highest costs for medical care around the globe. A single trip to the emergency room for a few stitches and some antibiotics can cost hundreds of dollars.</p>

<p>There is no sales tax on an item of clothing or footwear that costs less than $110. An item of clothing or footwear that costs $110 or more is subject to the full 8.875% tax rate.</p>

<p>Besides walking, this is the most economical way to travel, and the fastest.  If you want to get a real sense of New York, the subway is a great way to go. MIllions of people use it every day, and it runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. </p>

<p><span>Comfortable light shoes are the MUST!!!</span></p>

<p>Smoking is banned in public places throughout the City, including in bars, restaurants, subways and taxis. Cigar smoking is permitted at cigar bars that register with the City. In NYC, those who are 21 or older can purchase cigarettes and tobacco.
