<p><p>No matter where you stay, we hope you enjoy your visit to New York University and take advantage of the wonderful resources the City has to offer.
We can also give you an idea of where to look when you're looking at hotels.  Here's a brief overview:</p>
<li>Take advantage of <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com">TripAdvsior</a>, which allows users to narrow down their price and location preferences, in addition to reading reviews of each lodging facility. These are reviewed by travelers who have used Tripadvisor service. Customers will rate the hotels and give their reviews; </li>
<li>You can quite easily compare diferent offer and price range (Expedia.com; TripAdvisor; Booking.com;Orbitz.com; Travelocity; Hotels.com; Priceline) </li>
<li>Bringing us to our next pointâ€¦ consider buying a trip package! Often times when you buy airfare, accommodation, and activities as a bundle, the cost for each is much lower!</li>
<li>Try to make a reservation with options of "Free cancelation" </li>
<li><a href="http://www.eurocheapo.com/">Eurocheapo</a> is a site that helps travelers find cheap hotels in Europe, and, recently, New York City and San Francisco! Eurocheapo has an office in NYC, and they send their editors unannounced to thoroughly inspect the rooms and pass their recommendation onto the customers.  Just enter your travel dates in the search box and Eurocheapo will have a list of affordable hotel rooms from which you can choose.</li>
<li> It is worth of checking the websites such as <a href="https://www.groupon.com/travel/new-york-city/hotels?utm_source=rvs&utm_medium=afl&utm_campaign=7407035#">Groupon </a>and <a href="http://www.eurocheapo.com"> Living Social</a>. Both offer significant deals on New York City hotels, as well as trip packages.</li>
<li>Read "reviews"!</li>
	<p>Our biggest suggestion for finding cheap accommodation in New York City? Go in the off season! Nearly all types of accommodation are cheaper in the off season simply because the demand for rooms is much less. When is the off season? Winter months, though not near the holidays.  </p>
